    <p>JOHNNY SWIM, a folk-soul bluesy duo comprised of Abner Ramirez and wife Amanda Sudano, daughter of the late Disco Queen Donna Summer will captivate attendees during Westobou’s signature musical event on the historic Parade Grounds at the Old Academy of Richmond County. The duo, described as a hybrid of Lauryn Hill and John Mayer have recently garnered national attention with the release of their latest album Heart Beats, in addition to the first ever position as VH1's You Oughta Know: Artists On the Rise. Such an accolade has aided in driving their new releases to respectable positions on the Billboard charts and appearances on Late Night with Jay Leno, The Today Show and Spoleto Festival USA.</p><br/>
