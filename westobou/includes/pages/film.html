                        Dubbed by the L.A. Times as a superbly told, enjoyably dishy documentary, Versailles '73 illustrates, for the second time in history, Americans storming Paris in an epic battle this time a fight for fashion. Innovative American ready-to-wear designers were pitted against long-established French Haute couturiers in a rumble for dominance over the runway. This 2012 documentary not only retells the epic saga of an American victory during the iconic fashion fundraiser curated by celebrated fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert and former palace of Versailles curator Gerald Van Kemp, but also captures the powerful impact of black models on both the American and international fashion industries. Join fashion icon and Versailles '73 narrator Cameron Silver, alongside the film's talented director and producer Deborah Riley Draper for a luncheon and film screening inside historic Sacred Heart Cultural Center.
