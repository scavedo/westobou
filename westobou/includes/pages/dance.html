                                In a partnership with the Augusta Sports Council, Westobou Festival is proud to present the Color Run, the Happiest 5K on the Planet. This un-timed race, starting and finishing at the Old Academy of Richmond County, features upbeat music and color stations along the course where participants will be doused with different colors.

                                Celebrating an iconic career of over thirty years, the prestigious Mark Morris Dance Group is set to make their Augusta debut during an unforgettable evening of contemporary dance at the historical Imperial Theatre. MMDG will perform four pieces including Grand Duo, Jenn and Spencer, Going Away Party and the critically acclaimed piece Canonic  Â¾ Studies, described by the Boston Globe as an event where "Morris shows how a waltz can smack you in the face, causing you to keel over, and how its just as useful for staggering as for swooning."
