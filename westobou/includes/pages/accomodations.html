	<p>The Augusta Marriott finds itself centered in our beautiful downtown business district – curb-edged to the Savannah River and its serene brick Riverwalk. And, only blocks away from the festival’s main space headquarters, the Old Academy of Richmond County, the Augusta Marriott is a prime residence to stay. Restaurants, bars, art galleries, bookstores, and more are also only blocks away, either to walk or park, along Broad Street and down its numbered corners.</p>
