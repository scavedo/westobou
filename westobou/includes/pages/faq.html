                    <h3>How did the festival begin?</h3>
                    <p>In 2005, the Trustees of the Academy of Richmond County, who work on behalf of the Porter Fleming Foundation administering grants and fellowships to organizations and individuals who demonstrate excellence in the fields of education, literature, art, science, history, music and culture, had a vision of creating a festival that would enrich the residents and visitors of Augusta. There began the planning for the first Westobou Festival.</p>

                    <h3>Why the name Westobou?</h3>
                    <p>The Westobou River, the former name of the Savannah River, was derived from the Westo Indians who migrated to Augusta in the 1660's. The festival pays homage to the history of the first settlers in our community.</p>
